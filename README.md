# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Your Task

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

Visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **Select data set**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize.
   
2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   * Click on the markers for additional information

   * Legend displayed that provides context for map data.

### Level 2: More Data 

 Illustrating the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Pulled in a second data set to visualize it along side the original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

In this step ..

* Plotting a second data set on my map.

* Adding a number of base maps to choose from as well as separating out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Layer controls added to the map.
